    " In a high-tech greenhouse, you need to implement an automated irrigation robot that operates on a simple reflex logic to maintain soil moisture. The greenhouse consists of 9 planting beds, represented by a list where beds 2, 5, and 7 are initially detected as \"Dry\" and all others as \"Moist.\" The robot must traverse the beds sequentially from 1 to 9, checking the state of each bed; if a bed is \"Dry,\" the robot should water it, change its status to \"Moist,\" and print a confirmation message, but if the bed is already \"Moist,\" it should simply move to the next one, displaying the final status of all beds after the process is complete."
